ANALYSIS OF CURRENT PLANNER AGENT:
Metadata Store Implementation:
Has a robust DatabaseMetadataStore class with caching capabilities
Includes methods for managing schemas, tables, and relationships
Has change tracking and freshness checking
ISSUE: Not being utilized effectively in the main workflow
Discovery Service:
Has comprehensive database structure discovery
Can discover schemas, tables, and relationships
Includes error handling and retry logic
ISSUE: Not being called at the right time in the workflow
Query Context Analysis:
Current analyze_query_context method is too simplistic
Uses basic regex patterns
Doesn't properly handle interface queries
ISSUE: Missing semantic understanding of queries
Plan Enhancement:
enhance_plan_with_metadata method exists but has issues:
Assumes "public" schema for interfaces
Doesn't properly validate table existence
ISSUE: Not properly integrating discovered metadata
Response Validation:
Basic validation of required fields
No semantic validation of the plan
ISSUE: Doesn't ensure plan is actionable
ROOT CAUSES:
Initialization Issues:
Metadata store not properly initialized at startup
Database connection parameters not verified
Schema discovery not happening proactively
Context Management:
Current database context not maintained properly
Schema context not properly tracked
Interface table location not discovered properly
Metadata Integration:
Discovered metadata not properly integrated into plans
Cache not effectively utilized
Relationships not considered in planning
Query Understanding:
Weak semantic understanding of queries
Over-reliance on regex patterns
Interface-specific logic too rigid
