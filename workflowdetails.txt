Detailed Analysis of the Agent Workflow
Based on our code analysis and the debugging statements we've added, here's a comprehensive explanation of how the agent workflow functions:

1. Overall Architecture
The application uses a LangGraph-based workflow with multiple agents that process a user's question in a sequential manner. The workflow is defined in graph.py and consists of the following nodes:

Planner Node: Analyzes the user's question and determines the query type and relevant tables/columns
Selector Node: Selects the appropriate schemas and tables based on the planner's output
SQLGenerator Node: Generates an SQL query based on the user's question and selected schemas
Reviewer Node: Reviews the SQL query for correctness, security, and performance
SQL Executor Node: Executes the SQL query against the database
Router Node: Determines the next step based on the query results
Final Report Node: Generates a comprehensive report based on the query results
End Node: Finalizes the workflow and returns the results to the user
2. Agent Types and Their Functions
A. LLM-Based Agents
These agents use Large Language Models (LLMs) to process input and generate output:

PlannerAgent: Uses LLM to analyze the user's question and determine the query type, relevant tables, and columns.


# In planner_node function
planner = PlannerAgent(
    model=st.session_state.get("llm_model"),
    server=st.session_state.get("server"),
    temperature=st.session_state.get("temperature", 0),
    model_endpoint=st.session_state.get("server_endpoint")
)
plan = planner.invoke(user_question)

SQLGenerator: Uses LLM to generate SQL queries based on the user's question.

# In sql_generator_node function
generator = SQLGenerator(
    model=st.session_state.get("llm_model"),
    server=st.session_state.get("server"),
    temperature=st.session_state.get("temperature", 0),
    model_endpoint=st.session_state.get("server_endpoint")
)
response = generator.invoke(user_question=user_question)

ReviewerAgent: Uses LLM to review SQL queries for correctness, security, and performance.

# In reviewer_node function
reviewer = ReviewerAgent(
    state=state,
    model=st.session_state.get("llm_model"),
    server=st.session_state.get("server"),
    temperature=st.session_state.get("temperature", 0),
    model_endpoint=st.session_state.get("server_endpoint")
)
review = reviewer.invoke(user_question, sql_query)

RouterAgent: Uses LLM to determine the next step based on the query results.

# In router_node function
router = RouterAgent(
    state=state,
    model=state.model if hasattr(state, 'model') else st.session_state.get("llm_model"),
    server=state.server if hasattr(state, 'server') else st.session_state.get("server"),
    temperature=state.temperature if hasattr(state, 'temperature') else st.session_state.get("temperature", 0),
    model_endpoint=state.model_endpoint if hasattr(state, 'model_endpoint') else st.session_state.get("server_endpoint")
)
decision = router.invoke(state)

FinalReportAgent: Uses LLM to generate a comprehensive report based on the query results.

# In final_report_node function
final_report = FinalReportAgent(
    state=state,
    model=model,
    server=server,
    temperature=temperature,
    model_endpoint=model_endpoint
)
report = final_report.invoke(sql_query_results, workflow_history)



Non-LLM Agents
These agents don't use LLMs and instead use hardcoded logic:

SQL Executor: Directly executes SQL queries against the database without using LLM.

# In sql_executor_node function
from app import execute_sql_query
query_results = execute_sql_query(sql_query)



EndNodeAgent: Simply formats the final response without using LLM.

# In end_node function
end = EndNodeAgent()
response = end.invoke(
    user_question=state.user_question,
    final_report_response=final_report_response
)


Optimization for Common Queries
The system has optimizations for common queries like "list all tables" to bypass the LLM-based processing:

# In sql_generator_node function
if state.user_question.lower().strip() in ["list all tables", "show tables", "show all tables"]:
    print("Detected 'list all tables' query, generating standard query WITHOUT using LLM")
    standard_query = "SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE' ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;"
    # ...

Data Flow Between Agents
The data flows between agents through the state object, which is updated at each step:

Planner → Selector: The planner's response is passed to the selector.

# In planner_node function
return {
    "current_agent": "selector",
    "execution_path": state.execution_path + ["planner"],
    "planner_response": plan,
    "planner_agent": planner
}

Selector → SQLGenerator: The selector's response is passed to the SQL generator.

# In selector_node function
return {
    "current_agent": "SQLGenerator",
    "execution_path": state.execution_path + ["selector"],
    "selector_response": selector_response
}

SQLGenerator → Reviewer: The SQL query is passed to the reviewer.

# In sql_generator_node function
return {
    "current_agent": "reviewer",
    "execution_path": state.execution_path + ["SQLGenerator"],
    "SQLGenerator_response": response,
    "sql_query": sql_query,
    # ...
}

Reviewer → SQL Executor: The reviewed SQL query is passed to the SQL executor.

# In reviewer_node function
return {
    "current_agent": "sql_executor",
    "execution_path": state.execution_path + ["reviewer"],
    "reviewer_response": review,
    # ...
}

SQL Executor → Router: The SQL query results are passed to the router.

# In sql_executor_node function
return {
    "current_agent": "router",
    "execution_path": state.execution_path + ["sql_executor"],
    "sql_query_results": query_results,
    "sql_query": sql_query,
    # ...
}

Router → Final Report: The router's decision is passed to the final report generator.


# In router_node function
return {
    "current_agent": route_to,
    "execution_path": state.execution_path + ["router"],
    "router_response": router_response
}

Final Report → End: The final report is passed to the end node.

# In final_report_node function
return {
    "current_agent": "end",
    "execution_path": state.execution_path + ["final_report"],
    "final_report_response": report
}
